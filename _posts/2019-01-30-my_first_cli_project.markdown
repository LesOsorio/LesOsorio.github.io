  I don't believe I have ever dreaded anything more in my life. I know, that sounds terrible, but let me elxplain. 
I like coding. I find a certain satisfaction in purposely breaking something just to make it work again. However, coding has   been a difficult experience for me. My learning processes has completely changed and the way my mind is used to processing new information has had to be molded for me to really understand what I am learning; and even then, I still           struggled. In complete and utter honesty, I was afraid of simply starting. I was afraid of staring at that blank file, because I knew I would have no idea where to even start. Although, you can only be afraid for so long. 


 Getting started, thinking of what I wanted to do, I've always wanted everything I do in my life to be of some sort of benefit; either to me or to others. After a lot of thought and a change or five of mind, I decided to go with what has benefitted me most in life and has benefitted others as well. So I created a CLI that explains fifteen of the basic beliefs that Jehovah's Witnesses live by. (I am a Jehovah's Witness) 
 
 Creating this CLI, I had to scrape the jw.org site. Beginning to learn to scrape, I did not understand it AT ALL. On the lab I did, I read it through, followed instructions and did as much as I could on my own, and then asked for a lot of guidence. So starting this project I stayed as far away from scraping as I could. To start, I created an outline as to what I wanted my project to be and what I wanted it to do. This was such an important part for me, because it got me moving. From here, I started with what I knew; coding the methods I knew I needed and putting the information in that I wanted my project to display. 
 
 Beginning to scrape, I googled. A lot. 
 
 Scraping is not easy. At least for me, it isn't. A lot of what I googled was things I had learned already before, but couldn't remember or things I wondered if could work. Watching the DailyDeals WalkThrough was also a huge help, because although our projects were different essentially we were doing the same thing, scraping; and even if your first CLI project isn't scraping just watching someone who's coded for so much longer than you struggle and say that "it's okay to not know"  is such a huge comfort and support. 
 
 I procrastinated this project a lot, because I was afraid of failing; but while getting through this project I realized that failing is such a huge part of coding. You have to learn to be good at failing in order to be great at succeeding. Even now, after completing the project I still don't feel a hundred percent comfortable with doing it all over again, but I know that I am not afraid to anymore. I realize that I can do it. It's ALL about getting started.
