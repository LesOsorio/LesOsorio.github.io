   Booleans are true or false data types and they are expressed as *true* and *false.* Although, in some languages, not all, they are expressed differently. Some are expressed capitalized (*True*/*False*) and in others they are different words such as *"YES"* and *"NO".* Nonetheless, they all have the same concept. 
	 
 Boolean values are very useful when you want to tell your progam to preform certain lines of code under certain circumstances. For example, if it is *true* that I am hungry, then I will eat. Although, if it is *false* that I am hungry then I will not eat and continue about my day. 
	
 Now, in programming, control flow or the idea of telling your program to carry out certian lines of code under certain circumstances is based on wether a value is true or false. Ruby has a way of determining what is true and what is false. In Ruby only *"false"* and *"nil"* are considered false. Everything else is considered true. Even zero, empty strings, and integers are considered to be true values. 
 
 Furthermore, there is a trick you can use to figure out whether a value is true or false. The double banger (!!). The double banger are two exclamation points you can place infront of your value and it will return its data type; either *true* or *false.*
