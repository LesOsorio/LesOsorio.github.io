   The most important thing about Logic and Conditonals is understanding that it's a parallel to our language (english). 
For example, the if, else, and elsif statments compare exactly to how we express our desires based on certain circumstances. *If* I am hungry then I will eat; *else* if I am not hungry, I will not eat and so on. 

   Now, case statements are very similar to our *if/else* statements except that our case statements are a lot more efficient. Case statements are used to run multiple conditions against one value. Instead of our code having to compare one conditon at a time to our value; we can use a case statement and run multiple conditions at a time. Furthermore, using the case statements allows our code to look a lot cleaner and is a lot easier to read.
