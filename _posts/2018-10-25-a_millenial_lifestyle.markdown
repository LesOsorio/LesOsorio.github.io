   Growing up was particularly rough for me. Although, I do realize that it shaped me in many ways. I was a little over six-years-old when my dad left. We had a pretty good life when he was around, materialistically anyways, but when he left he took everything with him. After that my mom had to find a job that would help maintain a home and three lives. Little known fact, my mother didn't finsh high school; she dropped out at the age of fifteen to work in the fields to help maintain her family.  
	
Nonetheless, God is good and thankfully she was able to find a job that got us by. It's been twelve years and, my beautifully strong hearted mother, continues to work there. My mother gets up at 5am every morning to continue to give us a life she never had and, although I immensely appreciate everyhting she has done for my brother and I; I wish she'd do something she is passionate about. Her job has helped keep us alive for a while now, but I know she doesn't love it.. and I've never wanted that for myself. 
  
I have been fortunate enough to be able to choose what I want to do with my life and web development gives me what a lot of jobs can't. Growing up I wasn't ever sure about what I wanted to do with my life, but I did know that I did not want to dread waking up every morning to go to a job that I didn't care for; working just to make it to the next day. Web development is not consistent; in the sense that, as technology keeps advancing so does web development. Furthermore, in this field of work, one never finishes learning it, one is never done being challenged as to what they can accomplish and that is why I chose web development as my millenial lifestyle.
